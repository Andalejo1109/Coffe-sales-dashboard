### **Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to apply the data value cycleâ€”from understanding the problem to data preparation, analysis, and visualizationâ€”to help the cafÃ©'s management make informed decisions.

### **Business Problem**

The cafÃ© lacks clear visibility into which products are selling best, during which times of day customer traffic is highest, and which months are the most profitable. This analysis seeks to provide actionable insights to address these issues.
